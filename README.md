# Data Modelling :
Data modelling is the process of organising and structuring data so that it can be stored in a database and easily retrieved for analysis.
It helps define how different pieces of data relate to one another and how they are grouped together, in other words, it is a blue print of how data is stored.
There are two ways of organising the data called as star schema and snowflake schema
Star schema has the fact table in the centre surrounded by dimension tables resembling a star, hence the name.
Snowflake schema is a extension of star schema where the dimension tables are further broken down into more tables connected to it and in-turn the dimension tables are connected to fact tables.
